Hello !

This is a mini projet personal for learn SwiftUI. I follow the tutorial in HackingWithSwift https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16
This is the projet Day 16, 17 and 18.

This project gives me chance to introduce you to whole range of new SwiftUI functionality:
 Form, NavigationView, @State,

We creat an app who calculate who split a bill. We can add taxes and divide by number of people. They gave us the total per person

Thank you for reading
